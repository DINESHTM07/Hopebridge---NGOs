Thank you for your interest in contributing to HopeBridge — DAY 2.

Guidelines
---------
- Fork the repository and create a branch for your change (feature/your-feature-name).
- Keep changes focused and small. Open one PR per logical change.
- Include screenshots or short animated GIFs for visual/UI changes.
- For JavaScript changes, prefer small, well-tested functions and include comments for non-obvious logic.

Code style
----------
- HTML: semantic markup and accessible attributes where relevant.
- CSS: use the existing variables in `css/base.css` and `css/theme.css` rather than new hard-coded colors.
- JS: vanilla JavaScript, keep DOM IDs referenced by `js/app.js` unchanged unless the script is updated accordingly.

Pull request checklist
----------------------
- [ ] My change is small and focused
- [ ] I updated relevant documentation (README, comments)
- [ ] I tested the change locally and it works in major browsers

If you want help preparing a PR or running the app locally, open an issue and tag it with "help wanted".
